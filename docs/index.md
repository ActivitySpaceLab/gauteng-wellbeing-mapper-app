description: A mobile app for studying mental wellbeing in environmental & climate context
---

Welcome to the **Wellbeing Mapper** documentation website. Wellbeing Mapper is a mobile app for studying mental wellbeing in environmental & climate context. It has been developed as part of the [Planet4Health project](https://planet4health.eu), funded by the European Union. The app will soon be used for research involving volunteers in Guateng, South Africa, and Barcelona, Spain. It is currently in beta testing.

This site contains information aimed at app users (i.e. research volunteers and anyone who simply wants to use the app for their), ,

### About the Planet4Health Project

The [Planet4Health Project](https://planet4health.eu) is a Horizon Europe research initiative focused on translating science into policy through a multisectoral approach to adaptation and mitigation of adverse effects of vector-borne diseases, environmental pollution, and climate change on planetary health.

**Mental Wellbeing in Environmental & Climate Context**

Traditional studies on environmental and climate changes have predominantly focused on physical health. However, these changes also contribute to rising mental health and psychosocial issues linked to socio-economic threats, including emotional distress and exacerbation of existing mental health conditions‚Äîoften referred to as climate-related psychological distress.

This case study aims to collect and analyze mental wellbeing data alongside environmental data to develop a comprehensive understanding of mental health impacts. The project seeks to create integrated risk monitoring systems, map environmental hotspots, and provide solutions for better preparedness and response capacity.
