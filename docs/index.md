### Study Goals
- Understand relationships between place and mental health
- Identify resilience factors that promote wellbeing among people exposed to physical environment stressors (e.g. air pollution, high heat, drought, floods)
- Develop evidence-based guidelines for communities
- Support policy decisions for healthier urban environments

### Participation
- **Voluntary**: All participation is completely voluntary
- **Anonymous**: No personal identifiers are collected
- **Secure**: All data is encrypted before transmission
- **Ethical**: Approved by university research ethics committees

### Principal Investigators
- **Linda Theron**: linda.theron@up.ac.za (University of Pretoria)
- **Caradee Wright**: Caradee.Wright@mrc.ac.za (South African Medical Research Council)

### About the Planet4Health Project

The [Planet4Health Project](https://planet4health.eu) is a Horizon Europe research initiative focused on translating science into policy through a multisectoral approach to adaptation and mitigation of adverse effects of vector-borne diseases, environmental pollution, and climate change on planetary health.

**Mental Wellbeing in Environmental & Climate Context**

Traditional studies on environmental and climate changes have predominantly focused on physical health. However, these changes also contribute to rising mental health and psychosocial issues linked to socio-economic threats, including emotional distress and exacerbation of existing mental health conditions—often referred to as climate-related psychological distress.

This case study aims to collect and analyze mental wellbeing data alongside environmental data to develop a comprehensive understanding of mental health impacts. The project seeks to create integrated risk monitoring systems, map environmental hotspots, and provide solutions for better preparedness and response capacity.
