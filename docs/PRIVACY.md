# Wellbeing Mapper Privacy Policy

## Overview

Wellbeing Mapper is designed with privacy as a core principle. You have complete control over your data, whether you use the app privately or participate in research studies.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Location Data
- When location tracking is enabled, GPS coordinates are stored **only on your device**
- Location data includes coordinates, timestamps, and accuracy information
- No location data leaves your device without your explicit consent

### Survey Data
- Wellbeing survey responses are stored locally on your device
- Survey data includes your mood and wellbeing responses with timestamps
- Optional location context can be attached to surveys (with your permission)

### No Automatic Data Sharing
- **Private Mode**: All data stays on your device forever unless you manually export it
- **Research Mode**: Data is only shared when you explicitly consent through the data sharing dialog

## Research Participation (Optional)

### Voluntary Participation
- Research participation is completely voluntary
- You can switch between Private Mode and Research Mode anytime
- You can withdraw from research participation at any point

### Advanced Consent System
When participating in research, you have **three options** for data sharing:

1. **Share Full Location Data**
   - Complete 2-week location history with survey responses
   - Helps researchers understand environmental context fully

2. **Share Partial Location Data** 
   - **You choose exactly which location areas to share**
   - All areas start selected by default - you uncheck areas you want to keep private
   - Perfect for sharing public spaces while protecting personal locations (home, work, etc.)
   - Complete control over which geographic areas are included

3. **Survey Responses Only**
   - Only your mood and wellbeing answers are shared
   - No location data is transmitted
   - Still valuable for research while maintaining complete location privacy

### Data Sharing Preferences
- Change your sharing preferences anytime through the app menu
- View history of your consent decisions
- Update which location areas you're comfortable sharing
- Full transparency about what data will be shared before each upload

## Data Security

### Encryption
- All research data is encrypted on your device before transmission
- Uses industry-standard AES-256-GCM encryption
- Research teams can only decrypt data with their private keys
- Fresh encryption keys for each upload (forward secrecy)

### Anonymous Participation
- No personal identifying information is ever transmitted
- Random participant codes are used instead of names or emails
- Location areas are shown as general regions, not exact addresses
- IP addresses and device identifiers are not logged

### Data Retention
- Research data is automatically deleted from your device after successful upload
- You can manually delete all local data anytime
- Local data retention follows your device's storage settings

## Your Rights

### Complete Control
- View all data stored on your device
- Export your data anytime as JSON files
- Delete individual location records or survey responses
- Change data sharing preferences without penalty
- Withdraw from research participation completely

### Transparency
- Real-time preview of what data will be shared
- Clear summaries before each research upload
- History of all your consent decisions
- Open source code available for technical review
