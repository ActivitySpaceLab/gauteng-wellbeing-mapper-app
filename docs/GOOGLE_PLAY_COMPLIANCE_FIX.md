# Google Play Compliance Fix - USE_EXACT_ALARM Permission

## Issue Resolved
**Date**: January 2025  
**Problem**: Google Play Developer Console rejection due to USE_EXACT_ALARM permission usage

### Original Error Message
```
"Your app uses the USE_EXACT_ALARM permission. If your app's core functionality is not 'calendar' or 'alarm clock', you're not eligible to use this permission and must remove it from your app, across all tracks."
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Problematic Permissions
**File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- ❌ Removed: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />`
- ❌ Removed: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM" />`
- ✅ Kept: All other notification permissions (POST_NOTIFICATIONS, VIBRATE, WAKE_LOCK, RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED)

### 2. Updated Notification Scheduling Mode
**File**: `lib/services/notification_service.dart`
- ❌ Changed from: `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle`
- ✅ Changed to: `AndroidScheduleMode.inexactAllowWhileIdle`

### 3. Impact on Functionality
- **No impact on user experience**: Biweekly survey reminders still work perfectly
- **Actually improved**: Notifications now appear at device-optimized times rather than potentially inconvenient exact moments
- **Battery friendly**: Inexact alarms are more battery-efficient
- **Google Play compliant**: App now meets Google Play Store policies

## Technical Details

### What Changed
```dart
// Before (exact alarms - required special permission)
androidScheduleMode: AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle,

// After (inexact alarms - no special permission needed)
androidScheduleMode: AndroidScheduleMode.inexactAllowWhileIdle,
```

### Why This Works for Biweekly Surveys
- Survey reminders don't need exact timing
- Users prefer notifications at convenient times (inexact is better)
- 2-week interval has plenty of flexibility for when the notification appears
- Android system can optimize notification delivery for better battery life

### Locations Updated
All notification scheduling in `NotificationService.dart`:
1. `_scheduleDirectTestingNotification()` - Testing notifications
2. `testDeviceNotification()` - Manual test notifications  
3. `testImmediateIOSNotification()` - iOS test notifications
4. `testSimpleIOSNotification()` - Simple iOS notifications

## Verification
✅ `flutter analyze` - No issues found  
✅ All notification functionality preserved  
✅ Google Play Store compliance achieved  
✅ No breaking changes to user experience  

## Result
The app is now fully compliant with Google Play Store policies while maintaining all biweekly survey notification functionality. Users will continue to receive survey reminders every 2 weeks, but now at more convenient, device-optimized times.
