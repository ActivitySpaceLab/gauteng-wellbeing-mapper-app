# Quick Reference: Enhanced Notification System for Research Teams

## Overview
The Wellbeing Mapper notification system now uses a **dual-notification approach** for maximum research reliability. Participants receive both device notifications (even when app is closed) and in-app dialogs (backup system).

## Quick Testing Guide

### 1. Access Testing Tools
1. Open Wellbeing Mapper app
2. Navigate to: **Settings** → **Survey Notifications**
3. Use the testing buttons in the interface

### 2. Test Device Notifications
- **Button**: "Test Device Notification" (Green)
- **What it does**: Sends immediate system notification
- **Expected result**: Notification appears in device notification area
- **If it fails**: Check notification permissions

### 3. Test In-App Notifications  
- **Button**: "Test In-App Notification" (Blue)
- **What it does**: Shows traditional dialog
- **Expected result**: Dialog appears immediately in app
- **Use case**: Backup system verification

### 4. Check Permissions
- **Button**: "Check Notification Permissions" (Purple)
- **What it shows**: Detailed permission status and platform info
- **Key indicators**: 
  - ✅ Device Notifications: Enabled
  - Platform info (Android/iOS)
  - System initialization status

## Research Benefits

### Improved Response Rates
- **Before**: Participants only notified when opening app
- **After**: Participants notified even when app is closed
- **Impact**: Significantly higher survey participation rates

### Enhanced Reliability
- **Dual System**: Device notifications + in-app dialogs
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Android and iOS
- **Background Operation**: Survives app termination
- **Automatic Scheduling**: 2-week intervals maintained

## Troubleshooting

### Device Notifications Not Working
1. Check notification permissions via testing tools
2. Ensure participants have granted notification permissions
3. Verify platform-specific settings:
   - **Android**: Check "Allow notifications" in app settings
   - **iOS**: Check notification permissions in Settings → Notifications

### Backup System
- In-app dialogs continue to work even if device notifications fail
- Participants will still be prompted when they open the app
- No data loss or missed surveys

## System Statistics
- All existing notification statistics preserved
- Enhanced diagnostics available through testing interface
- Permission status tracking for troubleshooting

## Support
- Use diagnostic tools in Survey Notifications screen
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Contact development team with diagnostic output if issues persist
