# TODO list

The Google Play Developer Console gives me this error: "Your app uses the USE_EXACT_ALARM permission. If your app's core functionality is not 'calendar' or 'alarm clock', you're not eligible to use this permission and must remove it from your app, across all tracks." Would we be better of using an inexact alarm to trigger the biweekly surveys? It is not essential that they be given at the exact same time, only that they be given ever two weeks (down to the day, but not necessarily same hour or minute).
