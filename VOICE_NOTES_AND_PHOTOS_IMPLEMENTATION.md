# Voice Notes and Photos Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 📸 **Photo Functionality (Fully Functional)**
- **Camera Integration**: Users can take photos directly from the survey
- **Gallery Selection**: Users can select multiple photos from their device
- **Image Management**: 
  - Preview thumbnails with numbering
  - Delete individual photos
  - Maximum of 5 photos per survey
  - Visual feedback for photo limits
- **Storage**: Photos are properly saved and included in survey submissions
- **UI Improvements**: 
  - Better visual layout with photo counters
  - Clear "remove" buttons
  - Disabled buttons when limit reached

### 🎤 **Voice Notes Functionality (UI Ready, Recording Pending)**
- **Enhanced UI**: 
  - Professional recording interface
  - Play/pause buttons for each voice note
  - Recording controls (start, pause, stop, cancel)
  - Visual feedback during recording
- **State Management**: 
  - Proper tracking of recording state
  - Individual playback states for each note
  - File management system ready
- **Simulation**: 
  - Sample voice note creation for testing
  - Proper integration with survey submission
- **Database Integration**: Voice note paths are saved with survey data

## 🔧 **What Still Needs To Be Done**

### 📦 **Install Audio Packages**
Run this command to install the required audio dependencies:
```bash
cd guateng-wellbeing-mapper-app
flutter pub get
```

The packages have been added to `pubspec.yaml`:
- `record: ^5.1.2` - For audio recording
- `audioplayers: ^6.1.0` - For audio playback

### 🎙️ **Implement Actual Recording**
Replace the placeholder methods in `recurring_survey_screen.dart`:

1. **`_startRecording()`** - Currently shows a dialog, needs to:
   - Request microphone permissions
   - Start actual audio recording using `record` package
   - Save to a temporary file

2. **`_pauseResumeRecording()`** - Currently just toggles state, needs to:
   - Actually pause/resume the recording

3. **`_stopRecording()`** - Currently calls simulation, needs to:
   - Stop the recording
   - Save the file permanently
   - Add the file to the voice notes list

4. **`_togglePlayback()`** - Currently shows snackbar, needs to:
   - Use `audioplayers` package to play audio files
   - Handle playback controls properly

### 📁 **File Storage Management**
- Implement proper file naming and storage in app documents directory
- Handle file cleanup when surveys are deleted
- Manage storage space (delete old recordings if needed)

### 🔐 **Permissions**
Add microphone permissions to platform files:

**Android** (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

**iOS** (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`):
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to the microphone to record voice notes for surveys.</string>
```

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### ✅ **Ready to Use**
- **Photos**: Fully functional - users can take and manage photos
- **Voice Notes UI**: Complete interface ready for testing
- **Survey Integration**: Both photos and voice notes are properly saved

### ⏳ **Next Steps**
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install audio packages
2. Add microphone permissions to platform files
3. Replace placeholder recording methods with actual audio recording
4. Test on physical devices (audio recording doesn't work well in simulators)

## 🔍 **Testing Instructions**

### **Photo Testing** (Ready Now)
1. Open the recurring survey
2. Scroll to "Digital Diary" section
3. Test taking photos with camera
4. Test selecting photos from gallery
5. Verify photos appear in preview
6. Test removing individual photos
7. Submit survey and verify photos are saved

### **Voice Notes Testing** (After Implementation)
1. Open the recurring survey
2. Scroll to voice notes section
3. Tap "Record Voice Note"
4. Test recording, pausing, and stopping
5. Test playback of recorded notes
6. Test removing voice notes
7. Submit survey and verify voice notes are saved
