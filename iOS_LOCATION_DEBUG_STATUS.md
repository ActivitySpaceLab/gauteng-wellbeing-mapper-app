# iOS Location Permission Debugging Status - PAUSED

**Date**: July 29, 2025  
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Paused for Android Release Priority  
**Next Priority**: Android release for research urgency  

## Problem Summary

The iOS version of Wellbeing Mapper is **not appearing in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services**, preventing users from granting location permissions manually or through app requests.

### Key Symptoms
- ✅ App builds and runs successfully on iPhone
- ✅ No provisioning profile errors (fixed)
- ❌ App does not appear in iOS Location Services settings
- ❌ Location permission requests return `PermissionStatus.permanentlyDenied`
- ❌ Issue persists after complete app deletion and clean reinstall

## Investigation Completed

### ✅ Configuration Verified
- **Info.plist**: All required location permission keys present and correct
- **Entitlements**: File exists and is properly linked in all build configurations
- **Xcode Project**: CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS properly set for Debug, Release, Profile
- **Build Process**: No entitlement errors during compilation
- **Diagnostic Script**: `./ios-entitlements-check.sh` reports all configurations correct

### ✅ Attempted Solutions
1. **Fixed empty entitlements file** - Added then removed location entitlements
2. **Verified Xcode project linking** - All build configurations properly reference entitlements
3. **Complete app deletion and reinstall** - Fresh install still doesn't register app in Location Services
4. **Provisioning profile fix** - Resolved signing errors by simplifying entitlements
5. **Multiple entitlement configurations tested** - Both empty and populated entitlements files

### ❌ Persistent Issues
- App launches successfully but location permission system is non-functional
- iOS system doesn't recognize app as location-capable despite correct configuration
- Permission requests fail immediately with `permanentlyDenied` status

## Current Working Theory

The issue may be related to:
1. **iOS system-level registration bug** - App bundle not properly registering with Location Services daemon
2. **Apple Developer Account/Code Signing** - Development signing may not properly enable location services
3. **iOS version compatibility** - Testing on iOS 18.3.2, potential iOS-specific bug
4. **Bundle ID or signing inconsistency** - Something preventing proper system registration

## Files Modified During Debug

### Core Configuration Files
- `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements` - Currently empty but properly linked
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - All location permission keys verified correct
- `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Entitlements linking verified

### Debug Tools Created
- `ios-entitlements-check.sh` - Comprehensive diagnostic script (working)
- `lib/debug/ios_location_debug.dart` - In-app diagnostic screen
- `test/location_permissions_test.dart` - Unit tests for permission validation

## Next Steps When Resuming (After Android Release)

### Immediate Investigation
1. **Test on different iOS versions** - Try iOS 17.x vs 18.x
2. **Test with different Apple ID/signing** - Use different development team
3. **Compare with fresh Flutter project** - Create minimal location test app
4. **Contact Apple Developer Support** - This may be a system-level issue

### Advanced Debugging
1. **Console.app analysis** - Monitor iOS system logs during permission requests
2. **Xcode Instruments** - Profile location services integration
3. **Native iOS test** - Create pure native iOS app to isolate Flutter vs iOS issue
4. **TestFlight vs local builds** - Compare behavior in different distribution methods

### Potential Solutions to Try
1. **Add location entitlements back** for TestFlight builds specifically
2. **Use different bundle ID** to test if current one is "corrupted" in iOS system
3. **Try legacy permission request methods** alongside permission_handler
4. **Background location setup** - Test if background location capability enables foreground

## Code References for Resume

### Key Files to Review
```bash
# Main location service implementation
lib/services/location_service.dart

# App initialization and permission flow  
lib/ui/participation_selection_screen.dart (line 250+)

# Diagnostic tools
lib/debug/ios_location_debug.dart
ios-entitlements-check.sh
```

### Critical Log Messages to Monitor
```
[LocationService] Current permission status: PermissionStatus.denied
[LocationService] Permission request result: PermissionStatus.permanentlyDenied
```

## Impact Assessment

### Current Status
- **Android version**: Working (needs tablet screenshots for release)
- **iOS version**: Core functionality broken (location tracking non-functional)
- **Research impact**: iOS users cannot participate in location-based studies

### Workaround for Research
- Focus on Android release for immediate research needs
- iOS participants must wait for fix
- Document iOS limitation in research protocols
