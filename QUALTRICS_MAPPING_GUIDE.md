## Implementation Notes

### Simple Text Field Approach
All questions use simple text fields in Qualtrics to avoid complex question type matching issues. This ensures:
- **Reliability**: No question type mismatches
- **Flexibility**: Any data format can be stored
- **Speed**: Quick setup and testing
- **Debugging**: Easy to see exactly what data was sent

### Data Formats
- **JSON Arrays**: Stored as comma-separated text (e.g., "Work,Exercise,Socializing")
- **Numeric Scales**: Stored as text numbers (e.g., "4", "5")
- **Boolean Values**: Stored as "1" (true) or "0" (false)
- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-08-11T16:30:00.000Z")
- **Location Data**: Encrypted JSON as text

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test initial survey submission
dart test_initial_survey_simple.dart

# Test biweekly survey submission  
dart test_biweekly_survey_simple.dart

# Test consent survey submission
dart test_consent_survey_simple.dart
```
