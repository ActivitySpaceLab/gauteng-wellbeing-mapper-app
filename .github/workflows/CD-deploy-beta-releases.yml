          ## 📲 How to Download and Install
          
          ### Android Users
          **Download one of the beta APK files below:**
          - Choose any `app-beta-*.apk` file (Flutter automatically optimizes for your device architecture)
          - All APK variants work on modern Android devices - download any one
          
          **Installation steps:**
          1. Download any APK file from the Assets section below
          2. Enable "Install unknown apps" in your device's security settings
          3. Tap the APK file and follow the installation prompts
          4. Open Wellbeing Mapper and start testing!
          
          **⚠️ Beta Installation Notes:**
          - You can install this beta alongside the production version (different package names)
          - Beta versions may have bugs or incomplete features
          - Your feedback is crucial for improving the final release
          
          ### Android App Bundle
          The `app-beta-release.aab` file is for internal testing distribution.
          
          ### iOS Users
          **iOS beta builds are included but require proper signing for installation:**
          - Download `wellbeing-mapper-beta-ios.zip` which contains the unsigned iOS app
          - iOS builds in this release are unsigned (for distribution purposes)
          - For device testing, contact the research team for TestFlight access
          - Beta testers can re-sign builds with their own developer profiles
          - Bundle ID for beta: `com.github.activityspacelab.wellbeingmapper.gauteng.beta`
          
          ## 🔒 Privacy & Beta Testing
          - **Private Mode**: All data stays securely on your device during testing
          - **App Testing Mode**: Try research features without real data collection
          - **No Production Data**: Beta testing data is separate from production
          - **Full Control**: Delete all beta data anytime from app settings
