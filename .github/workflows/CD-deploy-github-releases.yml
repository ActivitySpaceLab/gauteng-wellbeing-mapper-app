          Welcome to the Wellbeing Mapper beta release! Thank you for helping us test and improve this privacy-focused app for mapping your mental wellbeing.
          
          ## üì± What is Wellbeing Mapper?
          Wellbeing Mapper helps you track your mental wellbeing and movement patterns. It can be used in private mode without sharing any data. One we release the final production version, it will also be possible for volunteers to use it in research mode, in which case their data will be synced with a research server. In this beta release, all features are available for private testing: no data is transmitted from your phone in this version other than feedback that you choose to send the developement team or data that you manually export. Any feedback you can provide will help us create a better experience for future users and research participants.
          
          ## ÔøΩ How to Download and Install
          
          ### Android Users
          **You should install one of the APK files below:**
          - `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (most modern Android devices)
          - `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` (older Android devices)
          - `app-x86_64-release.apk` (emulators/tablets)
          
          **Step-by-step installation:**
          1. Download the appropriate APK file from the Assets section below.
          2. Transfer it to your Android device (or download directly on your device).
          3. Enable "Install unknown apps" in your device's security settings.
          4. Tap the APK file and follow the prompts to install.
          5. Open Wellbeing Mapper and choose your mode to get started!
          
          **Troubleshooting:**
          - If you see "App not installed" or "Parse error", re-download the APK and ensure you have enough storage.
          - If you can't find "Unknown sources", look for "Install unknown apps" in your settings.
          - For help, email john.palmer@upf.edu with your device model and Android version.
          
          ### Android App Bundle (`app-release.aab`)
